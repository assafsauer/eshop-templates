# Argo Workflow for Kubernetes CI/CD Automation

This README outlines the use of Argo Workflow in automating CI/CD processes within a Kubernetes environment, and briefly touches on the synergistic benefits of using it in conjunction with ArgoCD.

## Introduction to Argo Workflow

Argo Workflow is a container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. It's particularly effective for managing complex CI/CD pipelines.

### Key Features

- **Automated CI/CD Pipelines**: Streamlines the process of building, testing, and deploying applications.
- **Multiple Workflow Templates**: Supports various workflows for different backend technologies.
- **Integration with Kubernetes Secrets**: Securely manages access to Git and Docker registries.

## Argo Workflow Day2 examples: 

you can find diffrent CI/CD workflows in the k8s/deploy/base/day2... 
the CI/CD workflows YAMLs are automating the existing services and source codes in the repo.
for example the `ci.yaml` defines workflows for automated builds of all the source codes.

### Workflow Examples

- **Node.js, Spring, and More**: Templates for building and pushing images using Kaniko.
- **Secrets Integration**: Uses `github-repo-secret` and `docker-credentials` for secure operations.

### Benefits of Argo Workflow

- **Efficient Automation**: Each code change triggers a new build, ensuring up-to-date deployments.
- **Customizable Workflows**: Easily adaptable to different CI/CD requirements.
- **Enhanced Security**: Leverages Kubernetes secrets for secure access to critical resources.

## Synergy with ArgoCD

While Argo Workflow excels in managing CI/CD pipelines, its effectiveness is further enhanced when used alongside ArgoCD, which focuses on the continuous deployment and management of application states in Kubernetes.

### Combined Benefits

- **End-to-End Automation**: From code commit to deployment, both tools provide a seamless automation experience.
- **Streamlined Operations**: ArgoCD's application management complements the CI/CD processes of Argo Workflow.
- **Unified Platform**: Together, they offer a comprehensive solution for Kubernetes application lifecycle management.

## Getting Started

To implement Argo Workflow (and optionally ArgoCD) in your Kubernetes cluster:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Access the configuration files.
2. **Customize the Workflows**: Adapt `ci.yaml` and other configurations to fit your project needs.
3. **Deploy with Kustomize**: Use Kustomize and Kubernetes CLI to apply the configurations.

Leveraging Argo Workflow, possibly in tandem with ArgoCD, provides a robust framework for automating and managing your Kubernetes deployments and CI/CD pipelines.
